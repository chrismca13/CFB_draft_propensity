A lot of people say that high school recruiting is the lifeblood of a good college football program. Additionally, the best NFL football franchises are said to do a nice job of "building through the draft," rather than signing expensive free agents.  

In our capstone project, we combine these two ideas, and try to predict the likelihood of a high school football recruit to be drafted in the NFL. We know that there is a strong relationship between a high school player's recruiting ranking and their draft propensity (see chart below).

Our goal is to consider not just their rating, but a variety of features such as the school they attend, their height/weight, and how far they travled from their home town. Our project leveraged a variety of machine learning techniques, including:

1. Unsupervised Learning for feature engineering with DBSCAN, PCA, and K-means

2. Supervised Learning with Random Forest Classifier, SVMs, and Logistic Regression, with the best and most stable results being the Random Forest Classifier with a mode f1-score of .87

3. We also conducted robust feature analysis, sensitivity analysis, and failure analysis.
